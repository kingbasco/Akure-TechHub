                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">March is a month to celebrate the incredible achievements of women around the world. This year, we turn our spotlight to three inspiring Nigerian women in Akure who are making their mark in the creative sphere.  
                                            From Cindy Uk-Ibiam, the creative nomad who is passionate about building the Akure creative community, to Odunola Victor-Ayegba, the IT whiz who is empowering teenagers through business education, and Ruth Alao (Cocozzy), the textile artist who is keeping African traditions alive with a modern twist, these women embody the power, innovation, and resilience that define women today. 
                                            As we look back to International Women's Day and celebrate Women's History Month, their stories serve as a reminder of the immense contributions women make to society and the boundless potential that exists when we break down barriers, inspire inclusion and pursue our passions.
                                            </p>
                                            <img src="assets/images/Cindy.jpg" alt="Cindy" style="width:500px">
                                            <h3 class="d_block fs_30 lh_40 fw_bold mb_11">Cindy Uk-Ibiam, Creative Nomad</h3>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">Cindy Uk-Ibiam isn't your typical 9-to-5er. This Akure-based creative nomad traded in the office life for a full-time pursuit of her artistic passions over two years ago. Her journey began with a leap of faith – competing in the Face of Beauty and Bride pageant in May 2022, where she placed in the top 5. This experience ignited a spark, leading her to the stage in three consecutive Akure plays, including a leading role as Mrs. Pilkings in  directed by Ayokunle Aji <a href="https://www.yorlandrepublic.com/blog/1473330_death-the-king-s-horseman-ayokunle-ajisafe-explores-the-cultural-clash-and-colonial-consequences-in-the-stage-play" target="_blank"><span>"Death and the King's Horseman"</span></a> safe (Ajii). </p>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">Cindy's talents extend beyond the stage. She has seamlessly transitioned into film, starring in short and feature films across Akure and Lagos. Alongside acting, she actively contributes behind the scenes on the film crew, recently taking on the roles of Set Designer for <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Ile-ayo-The-Musical/0IZM37M4DIC6ZX5U14WDWR2NS7" target="_blank"><span>"Ile Ayo the Musical"</span></a> (streaming on Prime Video) and Production Manager for "How To Get Over You" (premiering April 7th at Akure's Filmhouse Cinemas). Judging by her list of works, one can tell that Cindy is very passionate about the Akure Creative Community, Film especially.</p>
                                        <li><strong>Q: As a rising star, have you faced any gender bias in the industry? How did you navigate it? </strong></li>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">A: I honestly can’t say a whole lot about the entertainment industry because I’m really only on the outside looking in at this point but  I'm aware of the challenges young creatives, regardless of gender, face. The industry is not “safe” for the young and eager and “safe” not in the sense of physical security alone but also as regards mental health and creativity. Like every other industry in Nigeria, “having leg”(a Nigerian term for relying on connections)  is a pandemic that has left many people discouraged to pursue their dreams of being a part of the entertainment industry. And one way I hope to help this situation is by creating a platform for people to get the recognition they need by simply being qualified.</p>
                                        <li><strong>Q: Who are your female role models, and how have they inspired you?</strong></li>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">A: While I wouldn't necessarily say I have traditional role models, there are many women I admire and follow on social media.  These include Adaora "Lumina" Mbelu (a storyteller and creative), Oluchi Harrison (a content creator with a stunning personal style that I absolutely adore), Princess Audu (a modest fashion full time content creator), and Letitia Wright (a Christian Hollywood film star) to mention a few. And as far as inspiration goes, finding these women at one point or the other helped me embrace and become the person I am today. I enjoy seeing them as they exist in their respective spheres of influence. Watching them grow and overcome the obstacles and challenges they face and have faced lets me know that I am not alone no matter how unique I might be.</p>
                                        <li><strong>Q: What project are you most passionate about, and why?</strong></li>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">A: I’d say it’s building my portfolio and credibility as a full time Creative Nomad living in Akure. I started a Creative Community last year called “TheGIG” and as of today that is my biggest project yet as far as building my portfolio goes. We aim to change the face of Akure youth social-networking gatherings one hangout at a time. In February we successfully organised “The Great Dating Roulette” and this March it’s the “Boardgames and Books Hangout” for Nerds and Weebs. Overall we pursue a value-over-profit mindset and a “clean fun” approach.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Q: How do you navigate success in a male-dominated industry?</strong></li>
                                        <p class="fw_medium mb_35">A: Some of the strategies I have adopted over time to be successful in a male-dominated industry are; Collaboration over competition and a focus on exceptional service have been key to my success.  By building strong relationships and prioritising client needs, I've been able to establish myself and thrive in this environment.</p>
